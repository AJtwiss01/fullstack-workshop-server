/* TODO: Implement the resolvers for Mutation

Remember the resolver function signature:
fieldName: (obj, args, context, info) => result;

Check models/movie for the data fetching functions you'll need to complete the exercise.
Refer to your schema if you're unsure what to return from the resolvers.
Good luck!
